Welcome to my multithreaded Monte Carlo Simulation. This simulation if for approximating
the area under a curve (approximating an integral). Running the code will give you the
instructions for parameters to put in. Unfortunately, the function it approximates the
area for is hard coded (y=2x). Feel free to change this to a function of your choice in
the MyFunction class. Please note, my primary motivation for this small project
 was to practice some simple multithreading in Java. Enjoy :)
